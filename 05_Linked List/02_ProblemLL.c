 * @brief Insert an element at the kth position from the end of the linked list. 
 * Return true if success and if the list is not long enough, then return -1. 
 * Hint: Take a pointer to the head and then advance it by K steps forward. 
 * Take another pointer and then advance both simultaneously, 
 * so that when the first pointer reaches the end of a linked list,
 *  then the second pointer is at the point where you need to insert the node.
